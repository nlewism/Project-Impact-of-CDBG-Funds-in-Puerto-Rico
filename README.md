# Project Description
### Steps and Key Components of the Business Problem

**Impact of Government Programs:**

Analyze historical data from the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) to identify patterns or trends in funding allocation and its correlation with housing market fluctuations.

**Housing Affordability Metrics:**

Define and measure housing affordability metrics, considering income levels, interest rates, and mortgage amounts.
Evaluate how changes in government program funding may have influenced these metrics over the years.

**Temporal Analysis:**

Conduct a temporal analysis using FHA Single Family Portfolio Snapshot data from 2018-2022 to identify trends in interest rates, mortgage amounts, and home prices.
Assess whether changes in government program funding coincide with notable shifts in housing market indicators.

**Identification of Contributing Factors:**

Investigate potential contributing factors to home price inflation, considering both government programs and other external influences.
